Overview
Kid's Fun Zone is a capstone project in Web development program at @BrainStation Vancouver. The primary aim behind creating this application was to delve deep into the inner workings of JavaScript within a React-based environment.

This application features three entertaining games: Drumming on the keyboard, Drawing on the Canva and Whack-a-Mole. While I possessed a basic understanding of pure vanilla JavaScript for these games, I was relatively new to working with React.

To further enhance the application's personalization, I implemented JWT for authentication purposes and incorporated fun jokes into backend database, and integrated beloved Disney charactors from the Disney API. Additionally, I leveraged Three.js and Gasp.js for animation, injecting a dynnamica and engaging quality into thie app for kids' enjoyment.
